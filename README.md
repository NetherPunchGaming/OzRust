## Welcome

This is a Proof of concept project to help manage the OzRust servers and this repo exists for the community to provide feedback and report issues to the OzRust staff.

### TODO

- Create an issue template for server issues
- Create an abuse template for abuse complaints
- Create a Suggestion template template
- Create a project to track reported issues and planned work for clarity
- Create / find a bot to manage issues
- Create documentation and FAQ in this repo for common issues raised by the community player base (as required)

### Contributing

Please feel free to fork this repo and change what is nessisary to update documentation and create a PR to be reviewed by the OzRust admins or create an issue in this repo following the available templates.

(There is no guarantee you issue will be addressed or your PR will be merged back but we will provide as much feedback as is possible)

Please use the Templates available for reporting issues or abuse reports if the template is not followed it is unlikely your issue will be honoured or addressed before it is closed with no warning or resolution.

The OzRust admins are working to resolve all issues and suggestions but we make no guarantee that all issues will be addressed within a timeline unless specificaly specified.

Abuse will be blocked without warning and may result in ingame ban or other sanctions.
